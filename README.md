# RPC Plugin
This is a plugin that gives users on a Velocity proxy a resource pack, and automatically converts it for the user



## NOTE
This is very much in the early stages of development

Currently, it allows you to give it a resource pack, and downloads it only if you are on the correct version.



### Usage:

/rpc info - Gives information about the plugin

/rpc reload - Reloads the configuration

/pack info - Gives information on all packs on the server

/pack add <server_name> <pack_url> <pack_version> - adds a resource pack

/pack remove <server_name> - Removes all resource packs from the server
